D-Lab Technology Resources
--------------------------

Learn how to build and use D-Lab technologies! Whether you are working with a community that will greatly benefit from adopting these technologies, or you want to learn new building skills, or you want to set up a workshop to disseminate these innovations, here you will find all the materials that you will need:

*   **Background Notes**: Contextual information about the challenges being addressed, history of technology development, and project deployment status.
*   **Build-It Modules**: For students to learn basic shop skills while building a practical technology that can be disseminated in the field. Also comes in a version with teaching notes to provide more insight into the technology and guide the teacher/facilitator.
*   **Do-It Modules**: For making and disseminating D-Lab innovations. Uses minimal text and simple black & white drawings to facilitate translation, printing, distribution and implementation in the field. To help the documents last longer, we recommend laminating them or using sheet protectors.

### Charcoal

These documents describe the tools and processes needed to make charcoal from agricultural waste, which provides a clean-burning, environmentally-friendly alternative to wood charcoal.

*   Charcoal Background Notes ([PDF - 1.3MB]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mitec_701jf09_char_bg))
*   Charcoal Press Built-It ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mitec_701jf09_charpre_build))
*   Charcoal Press Build-It (with Teaching Notes) ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mitec_701jf09_charpr_bld_tn))
*   Charcoal Press Do-It ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mitec_701jf09_charpres_doit))
*   Charcoal Process Do-It ([PDF - 1.5MB]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mitec_701jf09_charproc_doit))

### Corn Shellers

These documents describe the tools and processes for making a simple hand-held device for removing the dried kernels from an ear of corn. The corn sheller can be either casted in aluminum or made from a sheet of metal.

*   Corn Sheller Background Notes ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mitec_701jf09_corn_bg))
*   Cast Corn Sheller Build-It ([PDF - 1.2MB]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mitec_701jf09_corncst_build))
